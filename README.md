# project-husky-MATLAB
MATLAB files for the ME Robotics Senior Design project. This project aims to create a six-degree-of-freedom Stewart platform that will be mounted to a ClearPath Husky A200. This platform will aid in the testing and development of UAV projects on campus by providing a more affordable and efficient means of small-scale testing.
